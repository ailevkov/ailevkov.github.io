                        <h2>Bulgaria Built a 5,150-HP Electric Hypercar and it's Out of This World</h2>
                    </header>
                    <br>
                    <p>In our roundup of 2017's best and worst hypercars last year, we declared that the 5,007
                        horsepower, 16-cylinder Devel Sixteen was the worst of the group. Besides having a
                        seemingly-undrivable amount of power, it was the worst offender in the current trend of small
                        companies producing hypercar concepts and renderings and never actually building the vehicles,
                        or building a one-off concept study. Thankfully Devel showed us proof that it wanted to produce
                        its satanic supercar, but there are still plenty of startups out there generating a lot of hype
                        but rarely ever a car.</p>
                    <p>We're interested to see where the new Alieno Arcanum lands on the spectrum of hypercar fact or
                        fiction. This Lamborghini-like vehicle was unveiled Friday by Alieno, which was founded in 2015
                        in Sofia, Bulgaria, and claims that it builds "hypercars from the future." Looking at the
                        Arcanum's detailed press release, this car seems to be the real deal and not some alien
                        conspiracy, although those videogame-like renderings aren't helping its case.</p>
                    <p>The Arcanum, whose name means "the secret of the secrets" in Latin, is an all-electric,
                        two-seater hypercar capable of 303 miles per hour in its most powerful form. Alieno is offering
                        four variants of the car, denoted by their Raw Power (RP) indexes: the least powerful RP2 has
                        2,575 horsepower (mechanical) and 3,245 pound-feet of torque, the RP3 has 3,433 hp and 4,366
                        pound-feet of torque, the RP4 has 4,291 hp and 5,458 pound-feet of torque, and the top-tier RP5
                        has 5,150 hp and 6,549 pound-feet of torque. It looks like the new Tesla Roadster has some
                        competition.</p>
                    <p>This ridiculous power and torque output comes thanks to Alieno's direct drive powertrain, which
                        features a minimum of three and a maximum of six electric motors (depending on RP) powering each
                        wheel. This multi-motor system means the Arcanum has some excellent active torque vectoring and
                        can provide all of its torque at any point in the rev range, from zero to maximum rpm.</p>
                    <p>These motors are powered by Alieno's own battery made from a combination of Graphene LiPo cells
                        and supercapacitors. Buyers can choose from three different batteries, each with a different
                        role. The 180-kilowatt-hour Street battery pack provides maximum range at 634 miles, while the
                        120-kilowatt-hour Track battery is optimized to allow for several miles on the track and not
                        much else. The 60 kilowatt-hour Race battery is used to shed the most amount of weight from the
                        car. Depending on the battery used, the Arcanum can run one to three full laps of the grueling
                        12.9-mile Nordschleife circuit at the NÃ¼rburgring on a single charge.</p>
